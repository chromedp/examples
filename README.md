# About chromedp examples

This folder contains a variety of code examples for working with
[`chromedp`][1]. The godoc page contains a number of [simple examples][2] which
are generally self-contained, while this repository holds more complex examples
which tend to require internet access or external components.

Please note that when the `chromedp` package is being rewritten, these examples
may break. Additionally, since these examples are written for specific websites,
there is a good chance that the current selectors, etc break after the website
they are written against changes.

While every effort is made to ensure that these examples are kept up-to-date,
it is expected that the examples made available here may occassionally break.

To file issues, use the [chromedp's issue tracker][3].

## Building and Running an Example

You can build and run these examples in the usual Go way:

```sh
# retrieve examples
$ go get -u -d github.com/chromedp/examples

# run example <prog>
$ go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/chromedp/examples/<prog>/main.go

# build example <prog>
$ go build -o <prog> github.com/chromedp/examples/<prog> && ./<prog>
```

## Contributing

Pull Requests and contributions to this project are encouraged and greatly
welcomed!  The `chromedp` project always needs new examples, and needs talented
developers (such as yourself!) to submit fixes for the existing examples when
they break (for example, when a website's layout/HTML changes).
