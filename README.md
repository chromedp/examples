# About chromedp examples

This folder contains a variety of code examples for working with
[`chromedp`][1]. Please note that when the `chromedp` package is being
rewritten, these examples may break. Additionally, since these examples are
written for specific websites, there is a good chance that the current
selectors, etc break after the website they are written against changes.

While every effort is made to ensure that these examples are kept up-to-date,
it is expected that the examples made available here
and working, As this is not a core part of the `chromedp` project,

## Building and Running an Example

$ go get -u -d github.com/chromedp/examples

# run example <prog>
$ go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/chromedp/examples/<prog>/main.go

# build example <prog>

## Contributing

Pull Requests and contributions to this project are encouraged and greatly
welcomed!  The `chromedp` project always needs new examples, and needs talented
developers (such as yourself!) to submit fixes for the existing examples when
they break (for example, when a website's layout/HTML changes).
